## Java-excercises

### This project is to practice some excercise that I found on internet.
### I will separate each excercise in different packages and I will try to create a javadoc for each method to explain what I did.
### Adding test for each excercise.
Excercises:

- Alternating characters
- Camel case
- Fibonacci
- Mars exploration
- palindrome number
- Palindrome word
- Pangram
- Prime number
- Sales by match
- Strong password
- Two characters
- Uruguayan Id
